## Backend Technologies

The **backend** of the Society Management System is responsible for handling business logic, user authentication, data management, and communication with the database. Below are the technologies used:

### 1. **Node.js**

- Node.js is used as the runtime environment for running JavaScript code on the server. It allows us to handle backend operations and create APIs efficiently.

### 2. **Express**

- Express is a web application framework for Node.js. It simplifies the creation of routes, middleware, and API endpoints for the application.

### 3. **JWT (JSON Web Token)**

- JWT is used for secure authentication and authorization. It allows users to log in and access protected resources in the application.

### 4. **Bcrypt**

- Bcrypt is used for hashing passwords. It helps in securely storing user passwords in the database by encrypting them.

### 5. **Cloudinary**

- Cloudinary is used for managing and uploading images and other media files. It helps store images like profile pictures and document uploads in the cloud.

### 6. **Nodemailer**

- Nodemailer is used for sending emails. It is useful for sending password reset emails, notifications, and other messages to users.
